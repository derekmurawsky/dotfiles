These are my daily driver dotfiles for my MacBook Pro. I use:

- [ChezMoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) - Manage your [dotfiles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dotfiles-what-is-a-dot-file-and-how-to-create-it-in-mac-and-linux) across multiple diverse machines, securely.
- [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/) - The Missing Package Manager for macOS (or Linux)
- [ZSH](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)
